# Deep Q-Network (DQN) for Taxi-v3 in OpenAI Gym

## Overview
This repository presents a Deep Q-Network (DQN) implementation for solving the Taxi-v3 problem from OpenAI Gym. DQN is a reinforcement learning technique that integrates Q-learning with deep neural networks, enabling efficient learning in complex environments.

## About Taxi-v3 Environment
In the Taxi-v3 task, an agent (taxi) operates in a grid-like environment, where it needs to pick up and drop off a passenger at different predefined locations. The challenge involves navigating the taxi optimally to minimize travel time and avoid incorrect actions, with the goal of maximizing overall rewards.

## Deep Q-Network (DQN) Explained
DQN extends the classic Q-learning algorithm by using a deep neural network to approximate the Q-value function. This approach addresses the challenge of learning in environments with large state spaces, where traditional Q-learning is not feasible.

### Key Components of DQN
1. **Neural Network for Q-Value Prediction**: A neural network predicts Q-values for each action in a given state, replacing the traditional Q-table.
2. **Experience Replay**: This technique stores the agent's experiences and samples a random batch of these experiences to train the network. It breaks the correlation between consecutive learning steps and stabilizes training.
3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: DQN uses an exploration rate (or epsilon) that decays over time, allowing the agent to explore the environment initially and gradually focus more on exploiting the learned policy.

## Solution Implementation
The implemented solution involves setting up the Taxi-v3 environment and defining a DQN model with fully connected layers. The training process involves:
- Encoding states into one-hot vectors for neural network processing.
- Utilizing a replay buffer to store and sample experiences.
- Updating the DQN model based on the experiences, using the loss between the predicted Q-values and the target Q-values derived from the Bellman equation.
- Gradually reducing the exploration rate to shift from exploring the environment to exploiting the learned policy.

### Key Aspects of the Code
- The DQN model is defined as a class with PyTorch's neural network module.
- The replay buffer is implemented to facilitate experience replay.
- The training loop includes mechanisms for exploration-exploitation trade-off and learning from minibatches of experiences.

### Running the Code
You can run the code in a Jupyter Notebook environment, ensuring all dependencies (Gym, PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib) are installed.

## Conclusion
This implementation demonstrates how DQN can be effectively used to solve a classic reinforcement learning problem. It showcases the power of neural networks in approximating complex Q-value functions and the effectiveness of experience replay in stabilizing the learning process.
